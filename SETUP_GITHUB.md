# GitHub Setup Instructions

Since Git is not installed on your system, here are the steps to upload your project to GitHub:

## Option 1: GitHub Desktop (Recommended)

1. **Download GitHub Desktop**: https://desktop.github.com/
2. **Install and sign in** to your GitHub account
3. **Create new repository**:
   - Click "Create a New Repository on your hard drive"
   - Name: `ai-learning-platform`
   - Local path: `C:\Users\samli\ai-learning-platform`
   - Initialize with README: No (we already have one)
4. **Publish to GitHub**:
   - Click "Publish repository"
   - Make it public or private as desired
   - Click "Publish Repository"

## Option 2: GitHub Web Interface

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Create new repository**:
   - Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
   - Name: `ai-learning-platform`
   - Description: "AI-powered learning platform with multiple formats"
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with README (we have one)
3. **Upload files**:
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop all files from `C:\Users\samli\ai-learning-platform`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Don't upload `.env` file (contains your API key)
   - Commit with message: "Initial commit - AI Learning Platform"

## Option 3: Install Git and Use Command Line

1. **Download Git**: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. **Install Git** with default settings
3. **Open Command Prompt** in your project folder
4. **Run these commands**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - AI Learning Platform"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ai-learning-platform.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Files Ready for Upload

✅ All project files are prepared
✅ `.gitignore` created (excludes sensitive files)
✅ `.env.example` created (template for users)
✅ `README.md` with full documentation
✅ Proper project structure

## Security Note

**NEVER upload your `.env` file** - it contains your API keys!
The `.gitignore` file prevents this automatically.
